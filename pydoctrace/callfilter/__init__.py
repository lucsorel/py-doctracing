class Preset(NamedTuple):
    '''
    Represents a set of two rules, each one being a function:
    - exclude_call should return True to exclude the call from the tracing process, True to trace it
    - include_call is called only if exclude_call returned True, and is expected to return True
      to force the tracing anyway (it offers some exceptions to the exclusion rule)

    The typical use-case is to exclude the call to all the functions of a given module in exclude_call,
    then to allow the call to some functions in include_call.

    Note: exclude_call must not be None, include_call can be None if the preset offers no exception rule.

    The method should_trace_call tells whether the call should be traced. The filter internally uses presets
    to help the user define exclusion rules. A preset gives the possibility to express large-grain exclusion rules
    with fine-grain inclusion rules.
